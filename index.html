        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p>I am Carina. I live in Neenah, WI, with my partner, Christian, and our cats,
            Sebastian and Garfield. I love trying new crafts and creating new cat enrichment. </p>
        <p>I am a Population Health Specialist at Network Health.
            I have a strong background in healthcare as a registered
            behavioral technician who specializes in Autism. I have a passion for advocating
            for the rights of the disabled and underprivledged in medical care. My educational dream
            is to study quantum computing, with healthcare applications.
            I want to use quantum computing to develop software which examines data and/or software
            which preforms drug research. </p>
